## DANM system

This is the main repository of our Data ANalsyis and Management (DANM) system for ALS research. Our framework aims to deal with the new challeneges that ALS researchers are facing nowday. Indeed Genetic technology is advancing rapidly. We now have the ability to quickly and cheaply collect huge amounts of genetic information, and because of close collaboration between research groups, to do this in tens of thousands of people. How to store, handle and easily share this information might reprensent overwhelming chanllanges. The aim of our DANM framework is to make all mambers of our research community able to deal with these aspects of our research in order to speed up our studies, make them more reliable and reproducible.
